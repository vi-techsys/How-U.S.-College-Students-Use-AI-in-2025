# How U.S. College Students Use AI in 2025: A Quantitative Snapshot
This repository contains the HTML implementation of a mixed-methods study investigating U.S. college students' behavioral and perceptual AI use in academic settings. The interactive webpage presents key findings, data visualizations, and frequently asked questions based on analysis of the StudyChat (2025) and Student AI Survey (2023) datasets.

## Executive Summary

The study explores the integration of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, into higher education. It synthesizes real behavioral data from ChatGPT interactions (StudyChat dataset) with self-reported attitudes and usage patterns from student surveys (Student AI Survey 2023). Key findings include:

* **Tool & Task Use:** ChatGPT is the most adopted AI tool (31%), frequently used for conceptual questions and code writing. Students rate summarization and grammar revision as highly helpful.
* **Behavior vs. Belief Gap:** Despite high perceived usefulness for planning and collaboration, actual usage in these areas is low.
* **Reasons for Non-Use:** Concerns about cheating, lack of perceived need, and low AI literacy are primary reasons for non-use.

The paper provides analysis, visualizations, and policy recommendations for educators to foster equitable, ethical, and effective student–AI engagement.

## Introduction

This section provides context on the rapid rise of generative AI in higher education and identifies the research gap addressed by this study: a lack of combined analysis of student attitudes, beliefs, and actual AI usage data. The research objectives are outlined, focusing on identifying AI usage patterns, comparing perception with behavior, and exploring ethical implications.

## Methodology

A mixed-methods design is employed, integrating behavioral log analysis from the **StudyChat Dataset** (1,197 anonymized ChatGPT conversations from an undergraduate AI course) and structured survey data from the **Student AI Survey 2023** (over 500 college students). Analytical procedures include frequency analysis, temporal trend analysis, prompt pattern mining for StudyChat, and descriptive statistics, comparative charts, attitudinal breakdowns, and thematic text analysis for the survey data.

## AI Use in Practice: StudyChat Behavioral Analysis

This section delves into how students *actually* use AI based on the StudyChat dataset. It details:

* **Task Categories & Usage Frequency:** Analysis of `llm_label` shows common tasks like conceptual questions, code explanation, and code writing.
* **Weekly Usage Timeline:** Identifies spikes in usage, particularly towards the end of the semester.
* **Prompt Strategy Insights:** Shows that students use a range of prompts from plain language queries to more complex, multi-step instructions.

## AI Perceptions: Insights from the Student AI Survey 2023

This section presents findings from the student survey, focusing on their attitudes and reported usage:

* **AI Tool Adoption and Preferences:** ChatGPT is the most used tool, followed by DALL·E, Mid Journey, and Bing AI.
* **Perceived Usefulness by Academic Task:** Students find AI most helpful for summarizing and grammar revision.
* **Reasons for Non-Use:** Highlights concerns about cheating and lack of knowledge as barriers.
* **Attitudes Toward AI in Education:** Shows that students largely view AI as an opportunity but also express concerns about fairness.
* **Training Expectations:** Reveals divided opinions on the importance of formal AI literacy training.

## Ethical Implications and Academic Concerns

This section discusses ethical considerations drawn from both datasets, including:

* **Fairness and Access:** Concerns about equitable access to AI tools and potential unfair advantages.
* **Overreliance and Ethical Use:** Observations of students attempting to offload entire tasks to AI.
* **Demand for Ethical Training:** The mixed views on the importance of AI guidance from tutors.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

Summarizes the key findings regarding widespread AI tool usage, the alignment (and misalignment) between behavior and belief, and the prevalent ethical concerns. It provides recommendations for:

* **Educators:** Emphasizing AI literacy, responsible prompting, and usage declarations.
* **Students:** Encouraging critical thinking, cross-checking AI output, and maintaining prompt logs for transparency.
